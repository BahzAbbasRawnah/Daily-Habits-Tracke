## ðŸŽ¯ What This Enables

With these configurations, your app can now:

1. âœ… **Schedule exact notifications** at specific times
2. âœ… **Handle recurring notifications** (daily, weekly, etc.)
3. âœ… **Restore notifications** after device reboot
4. âœ… **Use exact alarm mode** for precise scheduling
5. âœ… **Receive notifications in foreground** (iOS)
6. âœ… **Handle background notification actions**

---

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### 1. Clean and Rebuild the App

Run these commands to apply all changes:

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
flutter run
```

### 2. Test Notifications

Use your existing test screen (`notification_test_screen.dart`) to verify:
- Immediate notifications work
- Scheduled notifications fire at the correct time
- Permissions are granted properly

### 3. Request Permissions (Android 13+)

Make sure to call the permission request methods in your app:
```dart
await NotificationService().requestPermissions();
```

### 4. Troubleshooting

If notifications still don't work:

**Android:**
1. Check if "Exact Alarms" permission is granted in system settings
2. Ensure the app is not in the background app restriction list (Battery > App standby)
3. Check device-specific settings (some OEMs like Xiaomi, Huawei require additional permissions)

**iOS:**
1. Request notification permissions before scheduling
2. Check if notifications are enabled in Settings > Notifications

## ðŸ“‹ Important Notes

### Android Exact Alarm Permission
Starting from Android 12 (API 31), users need to explicitly grant the "Exact Alarms" permission. Your app handles this via the `permission_handler` package. Users can:
- Grant it when prompted
- Manually enable it in: **Settings > Apps > Habits Tracker > Alarms & reminders**

### Scheduled Notifications Limitations
Some OEMs (Xiaomi, Huawei, Samsung) have aggressive background app management. Users may need to:
- Add your app to the "Protected apps" list
- Disable battery optimization for your app
- Visit https://dontkillmyapp.com for device-specific instructions

### Testing Recommendations
1. Test immediate notifications first to verify basic setup
2. Test scheduled notifications with short delays (1-2 minutes)
3. Test recurring notifications (daily at specific time)
4. Test after device reboot to verify boot receiver works
